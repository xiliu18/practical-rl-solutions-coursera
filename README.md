# Practical RL Solutions Coursera
A repository of my solutions to:
- [Practical Reinforcement Learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-rl)

Notes: Some of the submission scripts on Coursera no longer work. Please refer to the discussion forums for tips and help. Also, the course have a more up-to-date repository here ([Practical_RL](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL)), in which the links to figures were updated.
